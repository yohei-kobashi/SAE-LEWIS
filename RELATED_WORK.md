### D.1 SAE features: detection is not command

Sparse autoencoders recover interpretable feature dictionaries from frozen
LMs [Cunningham et al. 2023; Bricken et al. 2023; Templeton et al. 2024],
and Gemma Scope [Lieberum et al. 2024] released JumpReLU SAEs for every
layer of Gemma 2 — the weights this work builds on. LinguaLens [Jing et al.,
EMNLP 2025] showed that linguistic phenomena are recoverable in this space:
it ranks base vectors by Feature Representation Confidence, the harmonic
mean of causal necessity and sufficiency, `FRC_k = 2·PS_k·PN_k/(PS_k+PN_k)`,
after an EALE sensitivity pre-filter at the 75th percentile, and verifies
the top-10 with an LLM agent.

**Crucially, LinguaLens uses those features only as an activation-space
knob**: it clamps a target feature's activation during the forward pass
(0 for ablation, 10 for enhancement) and reads off free-form generated text.

Its identification is also uncontested by construction. LinguaLens reports no
detection baseline — its only "baseline" is a random-25-vector control for the
*intervention* — and no standard detection metric (AUROC, AUC and F1 all
appear zero times in the paper), so FRC is an internal quantity that cannot be
compared against a linear probe or a difference-of-means direction. Its PS/PN
are moreover estimated on minimal pairs, where s+ and s− differ only in the
trigger: the easiest possible discrimination. AxBench, by contrast, is built
to be falsifiable — twelve methods under paired t-tests on passage-level
detection — which is exactly why it can conclude that vanilla SAE (0.695) is
"significantly outperformed by five supervised methods", and can price the
supervised feature-selection step that LinguaLens performs but never
evaluates (SAE 0.695 → SAE-A 0.917). Neither design is wrong; they answer
different questions. But it means the field currently has an *existence*
claim about linguistic SAE features (LinguaLens) and a *comparative* claim
about single-latent concept detection (AxBench), and no evaluation of whether
identified linguistic features are good enough to **act on**. That gap is
where P-B sits: it is the baseline comparison LinguaLens could not run,
because it has neither a competing conditioning signal nor a downstream task
with a ground truth to score against.
Editing appears in LinguaLens only on the *data-construction* side — its
counterfactuals are "produced through a minimal edit that deletes or
substitutes the trigger while preserving semantic content". **No prior work,
to our knowledge, uses SAE features as the conditioning signal for a model
that emits edit operations.**

That a property is decodable does not mean it is usable. Amnesic probing
[Elazar et al., TACL 2021] is a canonical statement of the point — "probing
performance is not correlated to task importance" — and it, along with
[Ravichander et al., EACL 2021; Hewitt & Liang, EMNLP 2019; Belinkov, CL
2022], reframed the question from *what is encoded* to *how information is
used*. Those works ask whether **the model itself** relies on a property
internally; we ask the adjacent question of whether **we** can use a feature
as an external command. Our P-B result extends the spirit rather than the
letter: **the very features FRC identifies as representing a phenomenon are
poor conditioning signals for editing it** — LinguaLens intervenes on 3 base
vectors per phenomenon, whereas conditioning our editor on FRC-identified
phenomenon features collapses exact match by ~10× relative to the k=32
instance-level features it needs. Detecting a feature and commanding with it
are different capabilities.

### D.2 The skeptical evidence, and why it does not reach us

The strongest negative results concern **steering specifically**. AxBench
[Wu et al., PMLR v267] evaluates on Gemma-2-2B/9B with Gemma Scope — our own
base model and SAE lineage — and concludes that "even at SAE scale,
representation steering is still far behind simple prompting and finetuning
baselines". Its two axes are concept detection and steering (`h + αw`); its
method set contains no editing method.

**AxBench runs the detect-then-intervene loop on the same latent, and it comes
apart.** Its SAE-A condition selects, per concept, the latent that best
*detects* it — "compute AUROC over the dataset given true labels, and select
the highest-scoring feature by this metric" — and then steers with that same
latent, since "we steer using SAEs by adding their decoder features directly
to the residual stream". Both conditions are evaluated on both axes. Selecting
for detection works: 0.695 → **0.917**, a 32% relative gain. Steering with the
selected latent does not: 0.165 → **0.157**, and SAE-A wins only 48.8% against
the very latents it was chosen to beat. The authors state it plainly: "**better
classification does not directly lead to better steering**." The pattern is not
confined to SAEs — Probe detects at 0.940 and steers at 0.098; SSV detects at
0.912 and steers at 0.026 — and their Figure 1 accordingly plots the two as
orthogonal axes.

This is the same experiment as our P-B, in a different modality. AxBench
improves *identification* of a concept by a third and gains nothing when it
*acts* through the identified feature; we condition our editor on the features
LinguaLens's FRC identifies as representing a phenomenon and watch exact match
collapse ~10×. Both say the feature that best identifies a phenomenon is not
the feature that best commands it — measured once through activation steering,
once through discrete editing. **We do not claim AxBench licenses our
conditioning** — it never evaluates an editing condition — but its result is
the reason a negative finding on the steering axis is not a negative finding
about SAE features as such, which is the axis we occupy.

AxBench's second axis, **concept detection**, asks whether one SAE latent can
identify a concept in a passage — the direct test of the monosemanticity
claim, and the prerequisite for any concept-level intervention. There,
vanilla SAE is "significantly outperformed by five supervised methods"
(0.695, 11th of 12). **Our pipeline performs no concept detection**: its
conditioning is the top-k of `z_tgt − z_src`, an instance-level encoding of
an observed feature-space difference, never a concept→latent lookup. That
distinction is not a way out, it is where our own negative result lives.
**AxBench's detection weakness and our P-B result are the same phenomenon
measured at two points**: they show concept→latent identification is
unreliable (0.695 AUROC); we show what that costs downstream (conditioning
the editor on FRC-identified phenomenon features collapses exact match ~10×).
We therefore read AxBench's detection axis as corroborating P-B rather than
opposing us — and, correspondingly, we scope our claim to *realizing* a
feature-level specification, not to *obtaining* one (§Limitations). Second,
[Kantamneni et
al., ICML 2025] find SAE probes fail to consistently beat logistic
regression across 113 datasets — though the finding is an absence of
*consistent* advantage, with SAEs winning on individual datasets — and
frozen/random-decoder baselines [arXiv:2602.14111] approach trained SAEs on
sparse probing. On causal editing that paper's headline 0.73 comes from its
Soft-Frozen variant, which still trains within a cosine-similarity ball; its
fully-random Frozen Decoder falls to 0.55–0.62, below trained SAEs'
0.72–0.74. DeepMind themselves listed whether SAEs beat fair baselines on
real tasks as an open problem when releasing Gemma Scope.

### D.3 Discrete editing: the operations are not the contribution

Text-editing models "produce the output text by predicting edit operations
which are applied to the inputs", in contrast to seq2seq methods that
"produce the output from scratch, token by token" [Malmi et al., NAACL 2022
tutorial]. The operation vocabulary is well-established: Levenshtein
Transformer [Gu et al., NeurIPS 2019] made insertion and deletion atomic,
LaserTagger [Malmi et al., EMNLP 2019] predicts tags over the input, and
LEWIS [Reid & Zhong, Findings of ACL 2021] — whose name we borrow — uses
insert/keep/replace/delete for style transfer. **We claim no novelty in the
edit vocabulary.**

What differs is the conditioning. LevT injects only the source sequence by
cross-attention; LaserTagger encodes only the input; LEWIS adds a supervised
style classifier's attention over a binary attribute. The closest prior work
to ours **does** condition discrete edits on an external specification: the
constrained-LevT lineage [Susanto et al., ACL 2020; Xu & Carpuat, TACL 2021]
injects terminology constraints at inference time from Wiktionary and IATE
dictionaries, and EDITOR lets users "specify preferences in output lexical
choice". **The specification there is a surface terminology dictionary; ours
is a feature dictionary recovered from the model's own internals.** The
contribution is the *kind* of specification, not the existence of one.

Edit Flows [Havasi et al. 2025] supplies our generative machinery — a
discrete flow over sequences via a CTMC, with the hazard factorization and
localization of its Appendix C.1 — but generates from scratch rather than
against a source, and conditions only on prefixes, images, or a CFG scale.

### D.4 Steering and its per-input unreliability

Activation steering [ActAdd; CAA; ITI; RepE] adds a direction to the
residual stream. Tan et al. [NeurIPS 2024] establish that "steerability
takes on a large range of values across different inputs, including negative
values, where SVs produce the opposite of the desired behaviour", coining
*anti-steerability*; on some datasets nearly half of inputs are
anti-steerable. **Their result is per-input within datasets whose mean
steerability stays positive; our negative per-phenomenon net-FRR (past_tense
−0.13, expressive −0.50, subject_verb_inversion −0.30) is an aggregate mean
going negative — a sharper form of the same failure.** Their study covers
CAA on Llama-2/Qwen-1.5 in a multiple-choice setting and involves no SAEs,
so we cite it for the phenomenon, not as a measurement of SAE steering.

LLM judges carry position bias [Wang et al., ACL 2024; Zheng et al., NeurIPS
2023 D&B] and are self-inconsistent under repeated identical queries
[Stureborg et al. 2024; Shi et al., AACL 2025; Haldar & Hockenmaier,
Findings of EMNLP 2025]. Measuring that reliability without human labels is
established practice: Conflict Rate [Wang et al.] re-queries with the
positions swapped, Repetition Stability [Shi et al.] re-queries "identical
queries multiple times", Rating Roulette [Haldar & Hockenmaier] runs each
judge three times to obtain intra-rater Krippendorff's α, and Sage [Feng et
al. 2025] assesses judges "without necessitating any human annotation". We
follow this line rather than depart from it; our order randomization is the
"more aggressive approach" already named by Zheng et al.

**Our only contribution here is a marginal-cost one.** Every method above
manufactures its duplicates and pays a dedicated re-run budget of 2–20×
judge inference. We pay nothing: because a pair whose output exactly matches
the target makes judge(src, out) and judge(src, tgt) the *same comparison*,
FRR restricted to exact-match pairs *is* the judge's self-consistency —
recovered from duplicates that the evaluation already contains. We are
careful about what this licenses: following Norman et al. [2026], what we
obtain is **reliability, not validity**. It also escapes the standard
degeneracy objection — a judge that always picks position A would score
perfectly on a consistency metric — only because we draw the gold and system
presentation orders from independent streams, under which such a judge
scores 0.50; had the two orders been coupled it would score 1.00.

**The measurement then does double duty, and this is the part that matters.**
Noisy-judge inference [Chen et al., arXiv:2601.05420] models judge error by
sensitivity q1 and specificity q0 and corrects via Rogan–Gladen,
`θ = (p + q0 − 1)/(q0 + q1 − 1)`. Inverting gives `p = (1−q0) + θ(q0+q1−1)`,
so for two systems **the intercept cancels**:
`p_A − p_B = (θ_A − θ_B)(q0 + q1 − 1)`. A paired gap is therefore *scaled*,
never shifted — attenuated toward zero with its sign preserved — **provided
the judge's error rates do not depend on the system** (non-differential
misclassification). That assumption is not free in our setting: steer emits
full regenerations while ef32 emits minimal edits, so judging difficulty
could plausibly differ. **Our per-system self-consistency is exactly the
diagnostic**: 0.9860 / 0.9926 / 0.9781 for ef32 / routed / steer under
GPT-4o, a spread of 1.45 points, under which the worst-case gap remains
attenuated. Unlike Chen et al.'s estimators we need no human calibration set,
because we need only the sign and a lower bound, which non-differential error
supplies for free.

### D.6 Routing by required edit size (反例(d): **確定**、第4ラウンド)

Systems that choose between generation strategies per input are usually
routed by a *learned* criterion: RouteLLM [Ong et al. 2024] trains on human
preference data to pick a strong or weak model by query difficulty and cost;
MoECE [Qorib et al., Findings of EMNLP 2024] gates GEC experts by *error
type*; ESC [Qorib et al., NAACL 2022] combines systems at the level of
individual *edits* rather than selecting a system's output; APR [AAAI 2024]
routes prompts by output quality. Closer to us, AdaEdit [Cheng et al.,
Findings of ACL 2026] switches per instance between a diff and a full
regeneration, choosing whichever is shorter — a monotone proxy for edit size
— but **internalizes that choice through supervised finetuning**, relabelling
its ground truth offline as `E_j = arg min_{S ∈ {C'_j, Diff(C_j,C'_j)}} |S|`
so that "the model implicitly learns to predict the more efficient format".
Conditional activation steering [Lee et al., ICLR 2025] does gate steering at
inference per input — **so gating steering is not itself new** — but its
condition is the prompt's semantic category, its branch is steering on/off
with both paths autoregressive, and its threshold comes from a grid search
over labelled examples.

Our router differs on the conditioning signal, not the idea. The count rule
is **explicit, unsupervised, and self-referential**: the number of edit hunks
the discrete editor's own λ field fires *is* the estimate of how much editing
this instance needs, so no router is trained, no labels are used, and no gate
is fit on a validation set. Editing-model practice, by contrast, treats "is
this task edit-shaped?" as a design-time decision over a corpus — EdiT5
[Mallinson et al. 2022] passes every input through tagging, pointing and
insertion unconditionally, and derives its "editing is favorable here" rule
from average decoder steps per task, offline.

### 系譜と操作語彙

| 手法 | 年/会場 | 操作語彙 | **条件付け信号** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Levenshtein Transformer (Gu et al.) | NeurIPS 2019, arXiv:1905.11006 | insertion + deletion のみ(**SUBなし**) | source sequence(cross-attention) |
| LaserTagger (Malmi et al.) | EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, arXiv:1909.01187 | タグ付け(語彙の正確な内容は**要再確認**) | 入力文のみ(BERT符号化) |
| LEWIS (Reid & Zhong) | Findings of ACL-IJCNLP 2021, arXiv:2105.08206 | insert/keep/replace/delete | source text + **スタイル分類器attention** |
| Edit Flows (Havasi et al.) | arXiv:2506.09018 | (**要再確認** — 0-3で棄却) | prefix / 画像 / CFGスケールのみ |

LevT 逐語: "Unlike previous approaches, the atomic operations of our model
are insertion and deletion." デコーダの分類器は Deletion / Placeholder /
Token Classifier の3つのみ。**訂正**: 置換は「複数イテレーションにまたがる」
のではなく**1イテレーション内**で実現 — "We essentially decompose one
iteration of our sequence generator into three phases: 'delete tokens –
insert placeholders – replace placeholders with new tokens'"。

LEWIS 逐語: "We propose a coarse-to-fine editor for style transfer that
transforms text using Levenshtein edit operations (e.g. insert, replace,
delete)." / §2.1 "The set of coarse Levenshtein transition types are
insert, keep, replace, and delete."

### 反例探索(a)(b) 陰性 — 条件付け信号の全在庫

- **LevT**: Appendix A 逐語 "we always omit the source information x in
  conditional sequence generation tasks such as machine translation which is
  handled by the cross-attention with an encoder on x." 全文検索で
  `style`=0, `attribute`=0。
  **🔴 査読で起きやすい混同**: §4 "Collaborate with Oracle" の "LevT has
  better interpretability and controllability" は**操作語彙**の性質であって
  条件付け信号の性質ではない。oracleは ground-truth へのアラインメント由来
  のトークン位置レベルactionで、言語的特性の仕様ではなく、policyを条件付け
  るのではなくdecode時に置き換える。この2つの "interpretable" を明示的に
  区別すること。
- **LEWIS**: 全文で sparse autoencoder / autoencoder / dictionary learning
  / sparse coding / interpretable features / feature dictionary /
  monosemanticity が**全て0ヒット**。
- **LaserTagger**: BERT-baseが入力系列のみを受ける。control code / style
  label / 潜在ベクトル一切なし。Google公式ブログの "controllable" は条件
  付けではなく**出力語彙の制限**を指す("By controlling the output phrase
  vocabulary...LaserTagger is less susceptible to hallucination")ため反証
  にならない。
- **Edit Flows**: 28ページv3 PDFを全文抽出しカウント: `sparse autoencoder`=0,
  `steer`=0, `style transfer`=0, `activation`=0, `probe`=0,
  `monosemantic`=0, `sae`=0。`interpret`=2は無関係な用法("interpreted as
  an insertion")、`feature`=1はソフトウェア的用法。39箇所の condition* 文脈
  を全列挙した結果、条件付けの全在庫は (i) ランダムprefix (ii) 画像early
  fusion (iii) CFGスケール(1.5/0.5/1.0)のみ。

### 🔴 主張(b)への最大の脅威(**未検証** — 第2ラウンドで確認中)

**制約付きLevT系譜**: Susanto et al. (ACL 2020) / EDITOR (Xu & Carpuat,
TACL 2021)。これらは「**離散編集を仕様(lexical constraints)で条件付ける**」
ことをまさに行っている。SAE-LEWISの差分は「**仕様がモデル内部から回収された
解釈可能な特徴空間に存在する**(表層の語リストではない)」点に置く必要がある。
一次資料未読 — Related Work執筆前に必ず確認。

### 🔴 軸2の残る穴

GECToR / EdiT5 / FELIX / Seq2Edits / discrete flow matching・diffusion text
editing は**通過した検証が存在しない**(Seq2Edits関連2件はいずれも1-2で棄却)。
特に「三操作語彙は新規でない」という重要な留保の根拠(GECToR/Seq2Editsが
replace系を持つ)**自体が未検証**。

## 軸3. Steering の限界

### Tan et al., "Analysing the Generalisation and Reliability of Steering Vectors" (NeurIPS 2024 main, arXiv:2407.12404)

我々の per-feature net-FRR 負値(past_tense −0.13, expressive −0.50,
subject_verb_inversion −0.30)の**公表済み先行事例**。逐語:

> "we rigorously investigate these properties, and show that steering vectors
> have substantial limitations both in- and out-of-distribution.
> In-distribution, steerability is highly variable across different inputs."
> "For all behaviours evaluated, steerability takes on a large range of values
> across different inputs, including negative values, where SVs produce the
> opposite of the desired behaviour."
> "Many of these datasets have almost half of the inputs being anti-steerable,
> implying that the effect of steering is highly unreliable."

"anti-steerability" は同論文の造語。著者: Tan, Chanin, Lynch, Kanoulas,
Paige, Garriga-Alonso, Kirk (UCL / FAR AI)。公表された異議は皆無で、後続
研究(arXiv:2505.22637; arXiv:2505.24859 — steeringの影響は "inconsistent,
negligible, or even counterproductive on some samples")は同方向に収束。

**🔴 引用時に必ず述べる2つのミスマッチ**:
1. **手法**: 評価対象は Contrastive Activation Addition (difference-of-means)
   **のみ**、モデルは Llama-2-7b-Chat / Qwen-1.5-14b-Chat、40のMWE系
   データセット+TruthfulQA中心の**多肢選択型**。論文中に**SAEは一切登場
   しない** → 「activation steering一般がper-input不信頼」の典拠として引用し、
   「SAE特徴steeringの直接測定」として引用してはならない。
2. **粒度**: Tan et al.の anti-steerability は**データセット内のper-input
   比率**(データセット平均のsteerabilityは概ね正のまま)。SAE-LEWISの
   net-FRR負値は **per-phenomenon の集計平均**であり、集計平均が負というのは
   **厳密により強い主張**。この非対称性は我々に有利 — Tan et al.は現象の
   存在の先行事例、負のnet-FRRは**より鋭い結果であって言い直しではない**。

**引用書式**: arXivは米綴り "Analyzing the Generalization..."、NeurIPS
proceedingsは英綴り "Analysing the Generalisation..." → 会議を引くときは後者。
二次アグリゲータの一部が "ICML 2024" と誤記しているので **NeurIPS 2024**。

## 軸4. SAE介入技術 / SAE懐疑論 — 第2ラウンドで確定(2026-07-15)

### 結論: AxBenchは我々を沈めない。**steering軸に閉じている**

**AxBench** (arXiv:2501.17148, "Steering LLMs? Even Simple Baselines
Outperform Sparse Autoencoders", Wu, Arora, Geiger, Wang, Huang, Jurafsky,
Manning, Potts, PMLR v267)。題名への回答として明言するのは
**representation steering がprompting/finetuningに劣ること のみ**:

> §7 "To answer the question in the title of this work: our evaluation shows
> that even at SAE scale, **representation steering** is still far behind
> simple prompting and finetuning baselines."
> §3 "We evaluate along two axes: **concept detection** C and **model
> steering** S."

steeringの定義は h_i + αw の activation addition。手法集合(DiffMean, PCA,
LAT, Probe, SSV, ReFT-r1, SAE, SAE-A, BoW, I×G, IG, Prompting,
SFT/LoRA/LoReFT)に**離散/編集系は皆無**。偽陰性対策(リガチャ正規化+
ハイフン折返し除去+`grep -a`)を施した全文検索で `levenshtein` 0 /
`edit distance` 0 / `discrete edit` 0 / `text editing` 0 / `rewrite` 0 /
`constrained decoding` 0 / `lexical constraint` 0 / `non-autoregressive` 0。
`insertion` 3件は全て合成データ生成用プロンプト文言、`edit` の全出現は
参考文献の "editors" と Meng et al. ROME の書誌のみ。

### 🟢 AxBench自身が検出軸とsteering軸の脱連関を実証している

> p.7 "Importantly, we note that SAE-A slightly underperforms the
> unsupervised SAE; **better classification does not directly lead to better
> steering**."

**著者自身のデータが存在証明**(camera-ready v3 / PMLR v267 の値):

| 手法 | 検出 (Table 1 Avg) | steering (Table 2 Avg) |
|---|---|---|
| SAE-A(教師ありAUROC選択) | **0.917** | **0.157** |
| SAE(教師なし) | 0.695 | **0.165** ← 検出で0.222劣るのにsteeringは上 |
| Probe | 0.940 | 0.098 |
| SSV | 0.912 | 0.026 |

**検出順位とsteering順位は一致しない**。Figure 1 自体が両軸を直交2軸として
プロットしている。→ 「SAE steeringが弱い」は「SAE特徴が現象を同定・条件
付けできない」を**含意しない**。

**🔴 較正(必ず守る)**: AxBenchは **editing condition を一度も評価して
いない**。よって detection↔steering の脱連関から「編集条件としての有用性
≠ steeringノブとしての有用性」への橋渡しは**類推**。**"direct support" と
書いてはならない**。正しい書き方: 「AxBenchはdetectionとsteeringが別軸で
あることを実証しており、我々の条件付け用途はsteering軸の否定的結果に直撃
されない」と、類推であることを明示する。なお SAE-A vs SAE のsteering差
(0.157 vs 0.165)は小さく原文も "slightly"、**有意検定は報告されていない**。

### 🔴 実質的脅威は検出軸 — vanilla SAE 0.695(12手法中11位)

Abstractの "On both evaluations, SAEs are not competitive" は**検出側に
ついては本文より強い断定**。本文逐語:

> "Overall, we find that DiffMean, Probe, and ReFT-r1 are the best performers
> with no statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between any of them
> under a paired t-test. Prompt, SAE-A, and SSV are not far behind and
> significantly outperform the remaining methods. LAT also performs better
> than random. **Vanilla SAEs are thus significantly outperformed by five
> supervised methods**, all of which are much cheaper to train using a
> limited amount of synthetic data."

Table 1 Avg 実測: DiffMean **0.942** / Probe 0.940 / ReFT-r1 0.938 /
Prompt 0.929 / SAE-A 0.917 / BoW 0.914 / SSV 0.912 / LAT 0.712 /
**SAE 0.695** / PCA 0.652。
**SAE-LEWISが教師なしで特徴選択するなら該当するのは0.695の方**。

### 🟢 ただし0.695のk=32レジームへの転移には構造的限界がある(我々の防御)

AxBenchのSAE検出プロトコルは**概念1つにつきGemmaScope latentを1本だけ**
使う(encoder/decoder列ペア1組)。そのlatent単体の活性でトークンをスコア
リングし平均プーリングでpassage-level化する。→ 測っているのは**単一特徴に
よる概念同定**であって、**約32個のinstance-level特徴の集合による条件付け
ではない**。論文内に多latent版は存在しない(3-0で確認)。

### 🔴 モデル差による逃げは効かない

AxBenchは Gemma-2-2B (L10/L20) と Gemma-2-9B (L20/L31) で Gemma Scope
事前学習済みSAEを使用。**2BについてはAxBench自身がbase LM学習SAE
(= SAE-LEWISが使う `gemma-scope-2b-pt-res` 系そのもの)を使用**。
→ **同一ベースモデル・同一SAE系列**。正面から用途の切り分けで応答するしかない。

### AxBenchへの唯一の正面反論も steering軸に閉じている

Jørgensen & Hansen (arXiv:2605.31183) はAxBenchの中核所見を**生き残らせて
いる**: 自身が「promptingにはなお及ばない」と明示的に譲歩し、達成した同等性
は**LoRAに対してのみ**。→ 論争全体がsteering軸に閉じており、AxBenchの否定的
結果は「SAE steeringはpromptingに対して弱い」にnarrowされるだけ。

### その他の懐疑論

**Kantamneni, Engels, Rajamanoharan, Tegmark, Nanda, "Are Sparse
Autoencoders Useful? A Case Study in Sparse Probing"** (arXiv:2502.16681,
ICML 2025)。SAE probeは4つの困難レジーム(data scarcity, class imbalance,
label noise, covariate shift)**すべてでデータセット平均としてロジスティック
回帰を下回り**、113データセット全体で従来手法に対する改善なし。
**🟢 限定**: 敗北は ensemble / "quiver of arrows" 基準での「**一貫した優位の
不在**」であり、**個別データセットではSAEが勝つ場合があると著者自身が明記**。

**SAEBench** (arXiv:2503.09532) の証拠は**両義的**(2-1で票が割れた):
k-sparse probingでSAEは「K本の残差ストリーム次元を直接probingする」
ベースライン(Gemma-2-2B L12で0.65)を有意に上回るが、(i) 当メトリクスは
アーキテクチャ・幅・sparsity間の識別力が乏しく Gao et al. (2024) の
"probe based metricはかなりノイジー" と整合し、(ii) Appendix Eで著者自身が
そのベースラインを **"a notably weak baseline"** と呼び、学習済みモデルの
残差ストリームprobingは**94%精度**に達すると記載。→ 結論は比較対象次第で
変わるので、**SAEBenchを一方向の典拠に使わない**。

### 🔴 最強の反論源: frozen/random SAE baselines (arXiv:2602.14111)

**abstractの見出し数値には反論可能な限定がある**(一次資料Table 2を逐語照合):
causal editing (RAVEL) で **0.73 を出したのは Soft-Frozen Decoder**
(ランダム初期化から cos類似 τ=0.8 内に留めつつ**学習を許す**変種)。
**方向を完全ランダム固定する Frozen Decoder は 0.55–0.62 に落ち**、
フル学習の 0.72–0.74 に明確に劣る。→ **「完全ランダム方向でも編集できる」
という強い主張は成立していない**。
一方 sparse probing では完全ランダムのFrozen Decoderが 0.669–0.702 と
フル学習 0.721 に肉薄 → **probing系指標こそ最も弁別力を欠く**。

**🔴 使えない防御**: 「同論文の causal editing はRAVELによる活性空間介入で
あり、SAE-LEWISの表層離散編集とはタスクが異なる」という切り分けは **0-3で
棄却**。単独の防御には使えない。Soft-Frozen/Frozen の区別で反論すること。

### 肯定側の母集団

**Gemma Scope** (arXiv:2408.05147, Lieberum et al., Google DeepMind,
2024-08) — 我々が使うSAE重みそのものの出所であり、AxBenchとの共通の土俵を
成立させている。**🟢 使える**: SAE公開側の当事者であるDeepMind自身が2024年
8月時点で「SAEが公正なベースラインと比較して実タスク性能を改善できるか」
「steering vectorとSAE feature steering/clampingの比較」「SAEが本当にモデル
の『真の』概念を見つけているか」を **open problem として列挙**しており、
**SAEの下流有効性が当初から未検証だったことの一次的根拠**になる。

**未確認(書誌情報だけなら足りるが、逐語引用するなら要追加確認)**:
Towards Monosemanticity (Bricken et al. 2023), Scaling Monosemanticity /
Golden Gate Claude (Templeton et al. 2024), Cunningham et al.
(arXiv:2309.08600), JumpReLU SAE (arXiv:2407.14435), TopK SAE (OpenAI),
OpenSAE。

### 軸4で棄却された主張(**書いてはいけない**)

| 棄却 | 票 | なぜ |
|---|---|---|
| 「AxBenchのSAE不振はNeuronpediaラベルによる特徴選択のconfoundのせい」 | 0-3 | **この言い訳は使えない** |
| 「AxBenchは steering as production intervention と features as causal ... を明示的に分離している」 | 0-3 | そんな分離は書かれていない |
| 「Kantamneni et al.は自らscopeをprobingに限定し他タスクへの一般化を自ら否認」 | 0-3 | 自己否認はしていない |
| 「懐疑論文自身がSAEが最先端である応用の存在を譲歩している」 | 0-3 | 有利すぎる譲歩は取れない |
| 「arXiv:2602.14111のcausal editingはRAVEL活性空間介入で我々とタスクが違う」 | 0-3 | **単独の防御に使えない** |
| AxBench v1 の数値 0.918 / 0.305 / 0.315 | 改訂済 | v3本文に0ヒット。v1のSAE-A 0.918はGemma-2-2Bの2設定平均をSAEの4設定平均と比べる**非対称比較**。**camera-ready (v3/PMLR v267) の値を引くこと** |
| 「最良のDiffMean(0.938)」 | 転記ミス | **0.938はReFT-r1、DiffMeanは0.942** |

## W. ブロッカー2件を一次資料PDFで解決(2026-07-15、自前でpypdf抽出)

要約器の誤りが多発したため、**arXiv/ACL AnthologyのPDFを直接落として
pypdfで全文抽出し、正規化(リガチャ+ハイフン折返し)した上で自分でgrep**
した。以下は**すべて実物からの逐語**。

### W-1. 🟢 P-Bの対比対象が確定 — 「介入は3本、編集には32本」

第1ラウンドで0-3棄却された定式化は**実際にはほぼ正しかった**(検証側の
偽陰性)。実物 §3.2 / Appendix E.1 逐語:

> "harmonic mean to penalise vectors that are only sufficient or only
> necessary: **FRC_k = 2· PS_k PN_k / (PS_k + PN_k)**."
> "The Feature Representation Confidence (FRC) is computed as the **harmonic
> mean of PN and PS**: FRC = 2 PN PS / (PN+PS). The harmonic mean is chosen
> because it ensures that FRC remains low if either PN or PS is low..."

**特徴同定パイプライン全体**(逐語):

> "We first perform **sensitivity pre-filtering** by computing EALE_k for
> every base vector and retaining those whose absolute value exceeds the
> **75th percentile**; on this reduced set we estimate PS_k and PN_k from
> every ⟨s+, s−⟩ pair and rank the vectors by their FRC_k; finally, the
> activation distributions of the **top-10 ranked vectors** are passed to an
> LLM agent, which verifies that each vector genuinely encodes the intended
> linguistic feature and flags any inconsistent or spurious patterns."

**🔴 P-Bの核心 — 介入に使う特徴数(逐語)**:

> "Furthermore, for each linguistic feature, we select **three base vectors
> with the highest FRC as representatives for intervention** and compute the
> average results across these three interventions."
> "We select **6 representative features** for the intervention experiments."
> (= 6つの言語現象。SAE特徴数ではない — 混同しないこと)

→ **対比は「LinguaLensは現象あたり3本のbase vectorで介入」 vs 「SAE-LEWISは
編集にk=32のinstance-level特徴を要する」**。**3 vs 32 ≈ 10×** で、P-Bが観測
した**10×の崩壊と数字が一致する**。P-Bはこれで書ける。

その他の逐語(使える):
- EALE = 個別latent効果の集約: τ_k(s) = a(1)_k − a(0)_k、
  "EALE_k = (1/N) Σ τ_k(s_i), which can rank base vectors by their
  sensitivity to the specified phenomenon"
- FIC (Feature Intervention Confidence) = 正規化ablation/enhancement効果の
  調和平均。"if one or both of the E values are negative, we incorporate a
  penalty coefficient w"
- **データ構築側の最小編集(第1ラウンドの警告を実物で確認)**: "produced
  through a **minimal edit** that deletes or substitutes the trigger while
  preserving semantic content"
- **🔴 LinguaLens本体は OpenSAE on Llama-3.1-8B(32層)** — Gemmaではない。
  "For SAEs, we use OpenSAE (THU-KEG, 2025) and its released checkpoints on
  32 layers of Llama-3.1-8B"。我々のB1はGemma+Gemma Scopeへの**忠実移植**
  である旨を明記すること(AxBenchのGemma論点とは土俵が別)。
- **題名**: PDF実物は **"LinguaLens: Towards Interpreting Linguistic
  Mechanisms of Large Language Models via Sparse Auto-Encoder"**。
  ar5ivは旧題 "Sparse Auto-Encoder Interprets Linguistic Features in Large
  Language Models" を返す → **投稿時に版と題名を確認**。

### W-2. 🟢 主張(b)の最近接脅威 = 制約付きLevT系譜 — 差別化点が確定

| | Susanto et al. (ACL 2020) | EDITOR (Xu & Carpuat, TACL 2021) |
|---|---|---|
| 仕様の中身 | **terminology constraints**(Wiktionary / IATE **用語辞書**、En-De bilingual dictionary entries) | **soft lexical constraints** = ユーザの **output lexical choice** の選好(トークン列) |
| 与え方 | **decode時に注入**、学習改変なし | imitation learningで学習 + decode時 parallel edits |
| SAE/解釈可能性の語彙 | **全て0**(sparse autoencoder/autoencoder/dictionary learning/interpretable feature/activation/steering/monosemantic/probe/latent) | **全て0**(同上) |

逐語 — Susanto: "our method **injects terminology constraints at inference
time** without any impact on decoding speed" / "Our method does not require
any modification to the training procedure and can be easily applied at
runtime **with custom dictionaries**" / 制約の出所は "En-De bilingual
dictionary entries extracted from **Wiktionary**" と "the **Interactive
Terminology for Europe (IATE)** terminology database"。

逐語 — EDITOR: "makes sequence generation flexible by seamlessly allowing
users to **specify preferences in output lexical choice**"。

**→ 差別化点は予測通りに確定**: 制約付きLevT系譜は確かに「離散編集を仕様で
条件付ける」が、その**仕様は表層の用語辞書/トークン列**である。SAE-LEWISの
仕様は**モデル内部から回収された解釈可能な特徴辞書**にある。**仕様の「種類」
が違う**と書けばよく、「仕様で条件付ける離散編集は前例がない」とは書かない
(それは即座に潰される)。

### W-3. 🟢 EDITOR は我々のM1 MOVE(NO-GO)の先行研究 — §7 Analysisで引く

EDITOR abstract 逐語:

> "It relies on a novel **reposition operation** designed to **disentangle
> lexical choice from word positioning decisions**, while enabling
> **efficient oracles for imitation learning** and parallel edits at
> decoding time."

我々のM1 MOVEは「syntax-decidableな移動可能性 → λ^mov が不整合な条件付けの
下で発火」で失敗した(empty ranking 0.15→0.39、random no_edit 0.50)。
EDITORは**まさにその oracle 設計を解いている**(語彙選択と位置決定の分離)。
→ M1のNO-GO考察は「op語彙の拡張は必要だが十分でない」で止めず、
**「EDITORはrepositionのoracleを設計して解いた。我々のMOVEは条件付け
コントラスティブな教師なしにop語彙だけ足したので失敗した」**と、
**先行研究に照らした具体的な失敗原因**として書ける(P5 corruption提案の
直接の論拠にもなる)。

## Z. 残る未達

| 項目 | 状態 | 影響 |
|---|---|---|
| AxBenchの正確な会場 | 未解決 | PMLR v267 (wu25a) は確認済だが OpenReview forum K2CckZjNy0 の記述と食い違う。**ICML 2025 / ICLR 2025 のどちらか要確定** |

## X. 棄却された主張 — **書いてはいけないこと**

3票の敵対的検証で 0-3 / 1-2 となり**使用禁止**。同じ罠を二度踏まないための記録。

| 棄却された主張 | 票 | なぜ危険か |
|---|---|---|
| ~~「LinguaLensはtop-3のFRC-ranked base vectorのみで条件付け、FRC=PSとPNの調和平均」~~ | ~~0-3~~ | **⚠️ この棄却自体が誤り(検証側の偽陰性)**。§W-1でPDF実物から逐語確認: FRC=調和平均の式も「介入は現象あたりtop-3のbase vector」も**本文にそのまま存在する**。複合主張だったため一部の不正確さで全体が落ちたと見られる。**3票検証にも偽陰性がある**ことの実例 — 棄却されても一次資料で確認する価値がある |

| 「LEWISには言語的特徴による条件付けが一切ない」 | 過剰 | スタイル分類器attentionという**学習された帰属信号**で条件付けており、「特徴を編集仕様に使う」の**最近接の隣人**。差別化は「**辞書としての解釈可能性**」に置く |

## X-2. 軸(d)で棄却された主張 — **書いてはいけない**(第4ラウンド)

| 棄却された主張 | 票 | なぜ危険か |
|---|---|---|
| 「AdaEditは**単一モデルの出力フォーマット切替**であって手法間ルーティングではない」 | **0-3** | 🔴 AdaEditを反例から外すために私が使いたくなる論拠。**使えない**。差分は教師あり(SFTで暗黙内在化)vs 明示的教師なし、の1点にのみ置く |

**🔴 CAST (ICLR 2025) による表現制約**: 「steeringに推論時ゲートを付けた初の
研究」と**書いてはならない**。CASTが先行(逐語: `h' ← h + f(sim(h, proj_c h))·α·v`、
`f = 1 if sim > θ else 0`)。ただし反例ではない — ゲート基準は**プロンプトの

## Y. 執筆時の手続き規則

1. **逐語引用はすべて自前のPDF全文抽出で再確認する。二次要約器を信用しない。**
   検出された捏造/誤りは**計6件**:
   - Edit Flowsについてabstractと正面から矛盾する記述(第1R)
   - LEWISについて存在しない大文字タグ(KEEP/REPLACE)を「逐語」と称した
     記述(第1R。実物は小文字と `<ins>`/`<repl>` マーカーのみ)
   - LinguaLensの介入特徴数を「5」と回答(実物は「**3本のbase vector**」/
     「**6現象**」)(W-1)
   - LinguaLensのEALEを「NOT FOUND」と回答(実物は定義あり・2ヒット)(W-1)
   - LinguaLensの題名を旧題で回答(W-1)
   - LinguaLensに存在しない一文 "We consider a base vector to be strongly
     related ... if its sufficiency probability exceeds 0.9" を §4.2.1 の
     逐語と称して回答 — **PDF全文に該当なし**(W-1)

   **確立した手順**: `curl -sL -o x.pdf <arxiv/aclanthology PDF URL>` →
   pypdfで全ページ抽出 → NFKD正規化 + `ﬁ`/`ﬂ` 展開 + `-\n` 除去 + 空白畳み
   → 自分で `re.finditer` する。
2. **grepの0ヒットを信じない。** PDFのリガチャ("ﬁrst")とハイフン折返しで
   偽陰性が出る(NAACL tutorialで実際に発生)。上記の正規化を必ず通す。
3. **3票の敵対的検証にも偽陰性がある。** LinguaLensのFRC/top-3の主張は0-3で
   棄却されたが、実物には逐語で存在した(§W-1)。**複合主張は一部の不正確さで
   全体が落ちる**。棄却されても、論証の根幹に関わるものは一次資料で確認する。
4. **「調べていない」と「探したが無い」を区別する。** 4ラウンド完了時点で
   「探したが無い」と書けるのは **(a)(b)(d)**。**(c)は先行研究が存在する**
   ので、主張は限界コスト(無償の自然発生重複の回収)にのみ置く(§D.5)。
5. **版番号と題名を投稿時に再確認する。** LinguaLensはarXiv旧題と現題が
   異なる(§W-1)。Tan et al. v6 (2025-05)、Edit Flows v3 が最新。
   AxBenchは camera-ready (v3 / PMLR v267) の数値を引く。
