"""
Intervention spec helpers (inference-time).

User-facing format:
    "+1234"  → amplify  feature 1234
    "-5678"  → suppress feature 5678

`build_intervention_vectors` converts a parsed spec + per-feature mean
activations (`mu`, from precompute_sae.py) into the two sparse vectors
`z_amp` and `z_sup` consumed by Proj_A.
