# IMPROVING THE INTERVENTION (2026-07-16). Target, per the research goal:
# OUR intervention must beat LinguaLens's clamp and the AxBench steering
# family on exact (and ideally FRR). Losing to prompting is acceptable.
# So the bar is not B1 — the bar is B3.
#
#   B1 clamp10  exact 0.1743   LinguaLens-faithful
#   B3 steer0.5 exact 0.2337   <- THE BAR
#
# B1's three handicaps, each removable, in order of known size:
#
#  1. RECONSTRUCTION. B1 does encode->set->decode, replacing the residual
#     with the SAE reconstruction everywhere. B3 adds the delta and touches
#     nothing else. That difference alone is +0.059 exact, already measured.
#     -> --intervention delta
#  2. SCOPE. LinguaLens intervenes at EVERY position because it does not know
#     where the phenomenon lives. A minimal-pair edit is local, so
#     intervening everywhere corrupts what should be preserved. The SAE says
#     where: the suppressed features FIRE at particular source tokens.
#     No training, no target — just the source's activation pattern.
#     -> --scope local        (UNTESTED — this is the new idea)
#  3. FREE REGENERATION. B1/B3 make the LM rewrite the whole sentence, so
#     every unchanged token is a chance to lose exact. Read the edit out of
#     the intervened LM's own head instead, teacher-forced.
#     -> the readout itself   (UNTESTED)
#
# Everything here is an intervention on gemma-2-2b's layer-12 residual
# stream, and nothing here is trained. The causal claim survives all three.
