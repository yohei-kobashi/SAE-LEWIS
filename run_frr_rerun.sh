# Re-judge the SYSTEM comparisons after the shared-rng fix.
#
# The bug: judge_feature_realization.py drew the A/B presentation order
# for the gold and system comparisons from ONE rng stream, so the system
# order depended on gold-CACHE STATE. run_frr_final.sh judges routed
# first, so routed spent draw #1 on gold and drew #2 for itself, while
# ef32/steer/steer_rnd found gold cached, skipped that call, and drew #1
# — the SAME order gold used. A position-biased judge therefore agreed
# with itself more often on ef32/steer than on routed, INFLATING their
# FRR. Since ef32 tops FRR and routed tops exact, the artifact pushed in
# exactly the direction of the paper's multi-axis claim; it has to go.
#
# GOLD IS STILL VALID (rng_gold reproduces the old first draw), so this
# re-runs system judgments only and keeps gold.jsonl. The old files are
# preserved as *.orderbug.jsonl and diffed against the new ones: same
# judge, same system, order correlated vs independent, so
#   FRR(orderbug) - FRR(fixed) = the position-bias inflation, measured.
#
# Usage:  JUDGE=openai:gpt-4o bash run_frr_rerun.sh      (CPU, ~3000 calls)
#         qsub -v JUDGE=hf:google/gemma-2-9b-it run_frr_rerun.sh   (GPU)
