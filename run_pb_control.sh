# P-B CONTROL: P-B as run cannot support "detecting != commanding".
#
# The problem, found 2026-07-15 by separating train time from test time:
#   training  conditioning = instance delta of the corruption pair, k drawn at
#             random from the top-64 candidates (intervene.py diff_to_sparse)
#   P-B eval  conditioning = instance delta MASKED to a phenomenon-level FRC set
# The mask is applied at eval only — no training script takes --feature-sets.
# So P-B hands the model a conditioning distribution it never saw, and a 10x
# collapse is what distribution shift produces regardless of whether concept
# features carry the information. As it stands P-B supports only "a model
# trained on instance specs cannot consume concept specs", which is nearly
# tautological.
#
# Worse, P-B ran with --conditions true ONLY, so it has no size-matched
# control. randomize_intervention gives exactly that for free: "same nonzero
# count and (permuted) magnitudes at random indices". So:
#
#   FRC-true ~= FRC-random  =>  the collapse is entirely the sparsity/shift.
#                               FRC's CONTENT contributes nothing and P-B
#                               proves nothing about FRC.
#   FRC-true >> FRC-random  =>  FRC content carries signal even under
#                               mismatch — the claim survives, weakened.
#   FRC-true << FRC-random  =>  FRC selection is WORSE than a random set of
#                               the same size. That is a real and striking
#                               finding, and the strongest version of P-B.
#
# Second control, free from P-D: P-B intersect's spec is delta AND FRC, i.e. a
# SUBSET of the instance delta. Training saw random subsets of the top-64, so
# the mismatch is mostly about SIZE. Compare P-B against the k-curve at the
# matched |delta AND FRC| rather than against k=32.
