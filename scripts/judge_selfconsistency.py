Judge self-consistency on exact-match pairs — an empirical noise floor
for FRR that needs NO human labels.

When a system's output is EXACTLY the target, the system judgment
judge(src, out) is literally the SAME comparison as the gold judgment
judge(src, tgt): same feature, same two strings.  A self-consistent
judge therefore scores realized=True on every exact-match pair by
construction, so

    FRR restricted to exact-match pairs  ==  judge self-consistency

and (1 - that) is the judge's disagreement-with-itself rate under
presentation-order randomization plus sampling noise.  Two consequences
for the paper:

  * FRR gaps smaller than the noise floor are not interpretable.
  * Judge QUALITY becomes partially verifiable without human labels: a
    judge that contradicts itself on identical comparisons cannot be
    trusted on the harder non-exact ones.  This is the empirical basis
    for choosing the primary judge.

Also reports FRR on the non-exact subset (where the judge is doing real
work) and the gold-indecisive rate (judge answered "equal" on src/tgt).
